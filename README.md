# FakeRealNews_Prediction_Machine Learning
This project uses a machine learning model which classifies news articles as fake or real using **natural language processing (NLP)** and **logistic regression**.It processes text data, extracts features, and trains a classifier to accurately predict the authenticity of news articles. It uses **TfidfVectorizer** for feature extraction and **LogisticRegression** for classification, aiming to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between real and fake news.

# Features:
 - **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans the text data by removing stop words and applying stemming.
 - **TF-IDF Feature Extraction:** Transforms text data into numerical values using TF-IDF.
 - **Logistic Regression Model:** Trains a logistic regression model on the processed data.
 - **Accuracy Evaluation:** Calculates the model's accuracy score on test data.

# Technologies Used:
Python Libraries:
- **numpy:** For numerical operations
- **pandas:** For data handling and manipulation
- **re:** For regular expressions in text processing
- **nltk:** For natural language processing (stop words, stemming)
- **sklearn:** For machine learning algorithms and utilities
